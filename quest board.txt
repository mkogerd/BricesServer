Quest Board:

The Player Request Board process begins by the player taking a note and quill from the chest and writing down their request details in the book. Be sure to include the location of the request and as many details as the Player accepting the request needs. Return the filled-out book to the chest and an official notice will go up on the board for anyone to accept. After a request is completed it will be removed from the board.
